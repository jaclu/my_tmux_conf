# more or less available keys

## prefix keys neither used by tmux default bindings or this

- g
- h
- k
- u
- v
- y

## Further prefix defaults that i think can be over-written

- . * move-window is not a shortcut I would ever use
- E * I have the seme on `<prefix> e` for easier touch keyb access
- i * the default window information is easy to find elsewhere
